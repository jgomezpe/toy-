# Toy+
Toy+ is a simple but powerful programming language (of the <A HREF="https://github.com/jgomezpe/funpl/">FunPL</A> class) developed by professor Jonatan GÃ³mez, Universidad Nacional de Colombia - South America, for teaching to think algorithmic solutions instead of teaching to code. In Toy+ you have just natural numbers and the basic operation addition that can be used to define (in the programming area) new commands. With those new compiled commands, it is hoped that arithmetic operations that the programmer's imagination defines can be built (running those in the command area).

Thre are two different implementations of Toy+: using Java and using Javascript:

## Java

For compiling the Java version, the following libraries are required: kerno.jar, speco.jar, kompari.jar, lifya.jar, jxon.jar, funpl.jar, aplikigo.jar and rsyntaxtextarea-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

&nbsp;These are available at <A HREF="https://github.com/jgomezpe/libs/">https://github.com/jgomezpe/libs/</A>

&nbsp;A Java IDE for programming in Toy+ is available at: <A HREF="https://github.com/jgomezpe/toyplus/run/toyplus.jar">https://github.com/jgomezpe/toyplus/run/toyplus.jar</A>

## Javascript

For interpreting the Javascript version, the following mosules are required: kompari.js, lifya.js, jxon.js, funpl.js and Konekti.js

A wrap version (including all required modules and Toy+ classes) is also available <A HREF="https://jgomezpe.github.io/toyplus/src/js/toyplus_wrap.js">https://jgomezpe.github.io/toyplus/src/js/toyplus_wrap.js</A> 

&nbsp;A web IDE for programming in Toy+ is also available: <A HREF="https://jgomezpe.github.io/toyplus/">https://jgomezpe.github.io/toyplus/</A>

&nbsp;A web course for learning (under construction) to program in Toy+ is available: <A HREF="https://numtseng.com/toyplus/">https://numtseng.com/toyplus/</A>
